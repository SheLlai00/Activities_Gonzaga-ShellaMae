Did the GIT is useful to the programmers and developers? yes/no: and why?
ans: Git isn't particularly useful in terms of computer development on its own. It is essential whether you're working in a group or want to keep your application versioned and it is easy to collaborate on large project and merge into Git. As a result, it is beneficial to programmers and developers in that it allows them to work with their team more easily.
